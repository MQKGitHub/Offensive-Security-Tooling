## 🛠 Offensive Security Tooling

Explore three offensive tools: Hydra, Gobuster, and SQLMap—used for penetration testing passwords, directories, and databases respectively.

This module teaches how to use Hydra for password attacks, Gobuster for directory enumeration, and SQLMap for SQL injection exploitation. It also includes an overview of different types of shells often gained during successful attacks.

### 🧠 Overview

### 🔓 Hydra  
- Learned how to use Hydra to brute-force login credentials on services like SSH and HTTP POST forms by automating login attempts with wordlists.  
- Practised identifying valid login responses and tuning Hydra options for performance and detection of failed logins. 

### 🧭 Gobuster: The Basics  
- Learned how to use Gobuster to enumerate web directories, DNS subdomains, and virtual hosts using different modes and wordlists.  
- Gained hands-on experience with `dir`, `dns`, and `vhost` modes while identifying hidden resources through brute-force techniques. 

### 🐚 Shells Overview  
- Learned how to use different types of shells in cyber security, including reverse shells, bind shells, and web shells, and how each one operates in real-world attacks.  
- Practised generating and triggering shells manually using tools like Netcat, Socat, and scripting languages like Python and PHP.
